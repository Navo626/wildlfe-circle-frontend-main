# Wildlife Circle Frontend

Wildlife-Circle is a dynamic web application built with React. It serves as a comprehensive platform for wildlife enthusiasts and an administrative tool for managing various aspects of the application. The application provides a range of features including user authentication, product and order management, blog viewing, a gallery, and a unique 3D forest view. It fetches data from an external API and presents it in a user-friendly format, offering detailed information about each product.
